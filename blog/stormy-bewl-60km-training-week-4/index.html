I don&#x27;t really mind crap weather too much, although I prefer it if it happens after I&#x27;ve started. Getting out there and embracing the suckiness of it all is part of the fun for me, so storms Ciara and Dennis didn&#x27;t really do anything to put me off – I take it as some extra head training. </p><p>The week started with a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3087802901">35 minute Tempo run</a> that I was not looking forward to. I&#x27;d had a fairly rough run the day before and wasn&#x27;t feeling confident about hitting what I needed to. But I got out there and it all just sort of clicked, I was aiming at 4:30/km average and ended up hitting 4:29/km, so that was good. </p><p>I should have seen the next bit coming, though. Whenever I have an unexpectedly good run, as in one where it takes no effort to outperform what I should be able to do, I can pretty much<b> guarantee</b> that the next day I&#x27;ll be full of cold. I have no idea how that works on a physiological level, but it&#x27;s been the case for as long as I can remember. Sure enough, Tuesday I felt like death. </p><p>So that was bad news, so the fact I had 10km to do Tuesday as well wasn&#x27;t ideal. I&#x27;d missed running with the club on Tuesday nights and knew they were having a run I could tack a couple of km onto to get to target, so I moved what should have been a Sunday run to Tuesday night. Surprisingly this one went excellently too, a little too much. I got a bit carried away and <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3091677159">ended up averaging 5:08/km</a> when it should have been closer to 5:45/km. Oh well! </p><p>The fact that I managed to miss the signs twice in a row is incredible, but obviously I woke up Wednesday with full on MAN-FLU™️. There was a strength and conditioning session in the plan, but ended up first postponing it until Thursday and then sacking it off altogether. It made sense to just rest up for Friday.</p><p>Friday was the longest run so far, 24km. I work a set of hours that lets me finish early on Fridays and get my long run in, but I&#x27;d managed to get sucked into writing some code and completely forgot to eat. Still needed to get out and running, so I did. What followed was a nice early bit of bonking practise. Not fun, but <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3099502962">got the 24 done averaging 5:52/km</a>. A little slower than the 5:45/km I wanted, but it&#x27;ll do. </p><p>Sunday was the last run of the week, and storm Dennis was starting to get going. I pretty much <i>always </i>run in full length leggings, but it was time to embrace the suck and get out there in shorts. <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3104559248">This was a varying pace session</a>, and I hit what I needed to hit. </p><p>Overall I got 54.1km done this week, which is actually the biggest week I&#x27;ve had in as long as I&#x27;ve been tracking my runs again. Happy enough with that despite dropping the gym session. Definitely don&#x27;t want to make a habit of that. </p><p>Next week brings my first double run day, as part of 3 consecutive days and then some rest before Brighton Half Marathon on Sunday. Hoping to be capable of ~1hr40m for that, which is by no means fast but would show I&#x27;m on the right track.</p><p></p></div></div></section><section><h2 class="center">Related Reading</h2><div class="grid" data-min="20rem" style="align-items: center;"><div class="media " style="position: relative;"><div><div style="display: inline-block; height: 100%; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://jason-dilworth.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/IMG_5608.max-500x500.jpg" alt="Working Out The Baseline – Bewl 60km Training: Week 5" style="vertical-align: middle;"></div><div class="" style="align-self: center;"><h4 style="margin: 0"><a href="/blog/working-out-the-baseline-bewl-60km-training-week-5/" class="stretched-link">Working Out The Baseline – Bewl 60km Training: Week 5</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="media " style="position: relative;"><div><div style="display: inline-block; height: 100%; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://jason-dilworth.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/IMG_9289.max-500x500.jpg" alt="Bewl 60km Training: Week 3" style="vertical-align: middle;"></div><div class="" style="align-self: center;"><h4 style="margin: 0"><a href="/blog/bewl-60km-training-week-3/" class="stretched-link">Bewl 60km Training: Week 3</a></h4></div></div></div></div></section><section><div class="box center" style="border: 0;">
