Headlines: Completed my sessions, didn&#x27;t get injured. If those two things can stay true for the other 15 weeks, I&#x27;ll be super happy. Anything more is a bonus.</p><p>Those who&#x27;ve had a look at <a href="/blog/bewl-60km-training-plan/">the plan</a> will know what was planned for this week, but here&#x27;s a run-down of how it went:</p><h2>Session 1: 35 mins Easy</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3027552526">Strava Link</a></p><p>Not much to say about the first session of the process – 35 minutes on a treadmill wasn&#x27;t the most heroic way to start a training block, but that&#x27;s how this one goes. My Polar M430 is wildly inaccurate at estimating pace and distance, but it&#x27;s more accurate than the treadmill itself. It has me down as having completed 5.6km in those minutes, but more important was average heart rate of 135bpm. Job done.</p><h2>Session 2: 13km Easy</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3030346692">Strava Link</a></p><p>I felt really good on this run. The sun was out, I&#x27;d been rested for the week before, and the biggest trouble was staying in my Easy zones – I&#x27;m trying to stick to the plan regardless at this stage, so getting excited and running away with it isn&#x27;t wise. 13km at 5:57/km at 159bpm average. A little higher than I should have been, but I&#x27;d have happily run these at 4:30/km so I&#x27;m putting it down as a discipline training win.</p><h2>Session 3: Strength and Conditioning</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3036080152">Strava Link</a></p><p>I can&#x27;t even remember what I did in the gym for this session, but I do know it felt like a waste of time I could have been running. I know that&#x27;s a lie though, and my previous constant injuries are testament to that. If this stays as the toughest session to do mentally each week I&#x27;ll be happy with that!</p><h2>Session 4: 60 mins Easy with 10 mins at Tempo</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3038227029">Strava Link</a></p><p>This one was my first taste of something not instantly clicking on the run side. Third session in, not ideal, but whatever. I felt fatigued, which I definitely shouldn&#x27;t have felt at this point. Couldn&#x27;t get the Tempo section anywhere near to the 4:30/km that I needed, which was tough to take as I&#x27;d felt so good in session 2. Didn&#x27;t force it though, just put in the relative effort that 4:30s would normally feel like and got it out of the way.</p><h2>Session 5: 13km &quot;Easy&quot;</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3044020200">Strava Link</a></p><p>Another relatively short run, but this time I decided to take it onto the Ashdown Forest. A friend at Uckfield Runners quips that &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as an easy run on the forest&quot; most times we head out there, and he&#x27;s absolutely right. Knowing that in advance, I just tried to move forwards with purpose for the distance. Took it as an opportunity to work on getting heart rate down between hills, and felt positive about that. Overall a really fun session, and I&#x27;m looking forwards to getting onto the forest for as many of my long runs as is sensible while keeping others on easier terrain for more pace.</p><p></p><p>Overall I&#x27;m happy with how the week went. Apart from Session 4 I felt in good shape for all of them, and the fact that Session 5 went well just points at the fact I was having an off day. We can all deal with those, so off into week 2 we go. At the time of writing I&#x27;m a few days into that, but the main sessions are coming up – including a nice 10 interval session tomorrow early morning.</p></div></div></section><section><h2 class="center">Related Reading</h2><div class="grid" data-min="20rem" style="align-items: center;"><div class="media " style="position: relative;"><div><div style="display: inline-block; height: 100%; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://jason-dilworth.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/IMG_5608.max-500x500.jpg" alt="Working Out The Baseline – Bewl 60km Training: Week 5" style="vertical-align: middle;"></div><div class="" style="align-self: center;"><h4 style="margin: 0"><a href="/blog/working-out-the-baseline-bewl-60km-training-week-5/" class="stretched-link">Working Out The Baseline – Bewl 60km Training: Week 5</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="media " style="position: relative;"><div><div style="display: inline-block; height: 100%; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://jason-dilworth.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/IMG_5049.max-500x500.jpg" alt="STORMY – Bewl 60km Training: Week 4" style="vertical-align: middle;"></div><div class="" style="align-self: center;"><h4 style="margin: 0"><a href="/blog/stormy-bewl-60km-training-week-4/" class="stretched-link">STORMY – Bewl 60km Training: Week 4</a></h4></div></div></div></div></section><section><div class="box center" style="border: 0;">
