On one hand, that&#x27;s a really nice feeling because it means I&#x27;m working. On the other it&#x27;s only week 3, so the main focus is still very much on injury prevention while getting the sessions done.</p><p>This week was also the first one with what I would class as a long run. The previous high of 16km was something I was happily putting out in the latter part of 2019 without feeling &quot;long&quot;, so getting up to 19km this week was a nice step up. Week 4 starts to ramp that up a bit more, so I&#x27;m looking forward to it.</p><p>The actual weekly distance still feels super low, but I&#x27;m trusting in the plan. Week 1 total was 41.6km, Week 2 total was 46.6km, and Week 3 has been 44.5km. That will definitely start ramping up too, and I&#x27;m looking forward to it.</p><p>Still missing the club, may swap my planned Tuesday and Sunday runs for week 4 to fit in a run with the rest of the clan.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the sessions:</p><h2>Session 1: 60mins Easy</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3068224241">Strava Link</a></p><p>This one was in London, as I happened to catch myself there between meetings. It felt really hard to be honest, hopefully down to not having eaten anything and carrying a decent sized bag.</p><h2>Session 2: 15mins Easy + 7x(60s Fast + 75s Recovery) + 10mins Easy</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3070057846">Strava Link</a></p><p>This was a nice workout to have, as it was super achievable – much easier than last weeks similar session. I did cut 5 mins off the planned 15mins easy at the end, as I had a decent level of calf twinge and wanted to use that time to stretch and roll before getting on with usual morning routine with the kid.</p><h2>Session 3: Strength &amp; Conditioning</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3073473778">Strava Link</a></p><p>Literally can&#x27;t remember what I did in this session, except that it was very much about mobility and stretching rather than any strength work.</p><h2>Session 4: 19km Long</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3080046372">Strava Link</a></p><p>Here&#x27;s that nice longer run. I actually had a pretty tough one, because I had struggled with a migraine the night before which came back around 3.5km into the run and got progressively worse for a while. At one point I couldn&#x27;t really see anything out of my left eye, which was a bit problematic but I was on a road I know well so that was OK. Felt pretty sick after that so this was very much a session to train the mind to keep going when it&#x27;s pretty minging.</p><h2>Session 5: 5mins Easy + 35mins Long + 5mins E</h2><p><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3084477593">Strava Link</a></p><p>Early morning running in Storm Ciara. Good to get the week finished before the weather got too crazy, but it still felt like running into a wall in some directions!</p><p></p><p>Week 4 is a good one: Starts with some Tempo work tomorrow, then a various pace run, 24km long run and a 10km easy effort. Should get me into the mid 50s distance wise, so bring it on. Until then, time for a roast and no beer.</p><p></p></div></div></section><section><h2 class="center">Related Reading</h2><div class="grid" data-min="20rem" style="align-items: center;"><div class="media " style="position: relative;"><div><div style="display: inline-block; height: 100%; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://jason-dilworth.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/IMG_5608.max-500x500.jpg" alt="Working Out The Baseline – Bewl 60km Training: Week 5" style="vertical-align: middle;"></div><div class="" style="align-self: center;"><h4 style="margin: 0"><a href="/blog/working-out-the-baseline-bewl-60km-training-week-5/" class="stretched-link">Working Out The Baseline – Bewl 60km Training: Week 5</a></h4></div></div></div><div class="media " style="position: relative;"><div><div style="display: inline-block; height: 100%; vertical-align: middle;"><img src="https://jason-dilworth.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/IMG_5049.max-500x500.jpg" alt="STORMY – Bewl 60km Training: Week 4" style="vertical-align: middle;"></div><div class="" style="align-self: center;"><h4 style="margin: 0"><a href="/blog/stormy-bewl-60km-training-week-4/" class="stretched-link">STORMY – Bewl 60km Training: Week 4</a></h4></div></div></div></div></section><section><div class="box center" style="border: 0;">
